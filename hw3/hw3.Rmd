# Introduction

>America does a poor job tracking and accounting for its unsolved homicides. 
Every year, at least 5,000 killers get away with murder. The rate at which 
police clear homicides through arrest has declined over the years until, today, 
about a third go unsolved.
<br/><br/>
The Murder Accountability Project is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 and 
dedicated to educate Americans on the importance of accurately accounting for 
unsolved homicides within the United States.

# Tasks

## Task 1

1. How many distinct counties in North Carolina had a recorded homicide in 2017?

73

```{r}
murder %>%
  filter(state=="North Carolina" & year==2017) %>%
  select(cntyfips) %>%
  n_distinct()
```

2. Which year and month combinations had the three most homicides in North Carolina from 2013 to 2017?

March 2016 (64), April 2017 (63), and August 2017 (70)

```{r}
 murder %>%
  filter(state=="North Carolina" & year %in% c(2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017)) %>%
  select(year, month) %>%
  mutate(yr_mo = paste(year, " ", month)) %>%
  group_by(yr_mo) %>%
  summarize(hom_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(hom_count)) %>%
  slice(1:3)

```

3. What were the top three states that had the most homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" that were solved and crossed racial lines, i.e., where the offender and victim were of different race? Include the counts in your answer.

California (12,916), Texas (7,273), New York (6,617)

```{r}
murder %>%
  filter(homicide=="Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" & solved=="Yes" & vicrace!=offrace) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(hom_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(hom_count)) %>%
  slice(1:3)

```

4. For the state of California, what is the relative frequency of unsolved homicides for each year in the data set?

```{r}
murder %>%
  filter(state=="California") %>%
  select(year, solved) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(perc_unsolved = sum(solved=="No")/n())
```

5. Define a variable `age_gap` as the offender's age minus the victim's age. For each offender sex level (not Unknowns), what is the median age gap, 10th percentile age gap, and 90th percentile age gap? Your output should be in a single data frame.

```{r}
age_gap_perc <- murder %>%
  mutate(age_gap = offage - vicage) %>%
  filter(offsex != "Unknown") %>%
  group_by(offsex) %>%
  summarize(Tenth_perc=quantile(age_gap, 0.1), Median=median(age_gap), Ninetieth_perc=quantile(age_gap, 0.9))
```

6. Which five states had the largest change in the number of homicides by "Murder and non-negligent manslaughter" in the
	10 years before and after the 1994 crime bill? Consider 1985 - 1994 and 1995 - 2004.
	
```{r}
temp <- murder %>%
  filter(year>=1985 & year <=2004 & homicide=="Murder and non-negligent manslaughter") %>%
  mutate(time_period = ifelse(year<=1994, "Before", "After")) %>%
  group_by(state, time_period) %>%
  summarize(hom_count = n()) 

temp2 <- temp %>%
  filter(time_period=="Before") %>%
  rename(hom_count_before = hom_count) %>%
  select(state, hom_count_before)

temp3 <- temp %>%
  filter(time_period=="After") %>%
  rename(hom_count_after = hom_count) %>%
  select(state, hom_count_after)

temp2$homecount_after <- temp3$hom_count_after

hom_count_data <- temp2

hom_changes <- hom_count_data %>%
  mutate(hom_change = abs(hom_count_before - homecount_after), hom_change_dir = ifelse(hom_count_before - homecount_after>0, "Decrease", "Increase")) %>%
  arrange(desc(hom_change)) %>%
  select(state, hom_change, hom_change_dir) 
  
hom_count_data_top5 <-hom_changes[1:5,]
hom_count_data_top5
```

Our purpose was to investigate patterns of homicides occuring in the US before and after the passage of the 1994 crime bill. Specifically, we analyzed and compared homicides occurring in the 10 years preceding and 10 years following the passage of the bill, and considered what this data might be indicating about the effects of the bill. 

First, we look at a straightforward measure of the after-effects of the bill: Did homicides decrease? We consider this on a state-by-state basis, and in terms of both absolute and relative change. Figure 1 shows that many states did not appaear to have an extreme absolute change in homicides relative to several populous states that did show a large decrease: California, Texas, and New York. Looking at the relative change in homicides (Figure 2) shows that although most states did tend to have a decrease, a decent number of states exhibited an increase as well. According to this general measure, it seems the crime bill might not have had as strong an effect on decreasing crime within each state individually as we might have guessed. 

```{r}
temp4 <- murder %>%
  filter(year>=1985 & year <=2004) %>%
  mutate(time_period = ifelse(year<=1994, "Before", "After")) %>%
  group_by(state, time_period) %>%
  summarize(hom_count = n()) 
temp5 <- temp4 %>%
  filter(time_period=="Before") %>%
  rename(hom_count_before = hom_count) %>%
  select(state, hom_count_before)
temp6 <- temp4 %>%
  filter(time_period=="After") %>%
  rename(hom_count_after = hom_count) %>%
  select(state, hom_count_after)
temp5$hom_count_after <- temp3$hom_count_after
homicides <- temp5
homicides <- homicides %>%
  mutate(hom_change_amount = hom_count_after - hom_count_before) %>%
  mutate(hom_change_degree = hom_change_amount/hom_count_before) %>%
  select(state, hom_change_amount, hom_change_degree)
```


```{r theme_map function}
theme_map <- function(base_size = 9, base_family = "") {
}
```

```{r}
us_states <- map_data("state")
homicides$region <- tolower(homicides$state)
us_states_hom <- inner_join(us_states, homicides, by = "region")
ggplot(data = us_states_hom, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = hom_change_amount)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "gray90", size = 0.1) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "white", high = "blue", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Change in Number of Homicides") +
  theme_map() + 
  labs(fill = "Amount")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = us_states_hom, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = hom_change_degree)) + 
  geom_polygon(color ="gray90", size = 0.1) + 
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "white", high = "blue", midpoint = 0) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 2: Change in Rate of Homicides") + 
  theme_map() + 
  labs(fill = "Growth Rate")
```

While the above visualization provides a big-picture overview of the effects of the crime bill, we can also consider data related to more specific elements of the bill. One of the provisions of the bill was the addition of new restrictions on who was allowed to possess firearms. Therefore it is of interest to see whether the proportion of murders involving guns decreased over time. We will analyze this for the US as a whole as well as for the four goegraphical sub-regions of the US. 

```{r}
# restrict to years around crime bill
murder_cb <- murder %>%
  filter(year>=1985 & year <=2004) 
```

```{r}
Northeast <- c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania")
Midwest <- c("Illinois", "Indiana", "Michigan", "Ohio", "Wisconsin", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota", "South Dakota")
South <- c("Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Maryland", "North Carolina", "South Carolina", "Virginia", "District of Columbia", "West Virginia", "Alabama", "Kentucky", "Mississippi", "Tennessee", "Arkansas", "Louisiana", "Oklahoma", "Texas")
West <- c("Arizona", "Colorado", "Idaho", "Montana", "Nevada", "New Mexico", "Utah", "Wyoming", "Alaska", "California", "Hawaii", "Oregon", "Washington")


# create new variable: gun used or not
murder_cb <- murder_cb %>%
  mutate(gun = ifelse(weapon %in% c("Firearm, type not stated","Handgun - pistol, revolver, etc", "Rifle", "Shotgun", "Other gun"), 1, 0), 
         region= ifelse(state %in% Northeast, "Northeast", ifelse(state %in% Midwest, "Midwest", ifelse(state %in% South, "South", "West"))))
```

```{r}
gun_summ <- murder_cb %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(perc_gun = sum(gun==1)/n())
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gun_summ, aes(x = year, y = perc_gun)) +
  geom_point_interactive() +
  labs(title = 'Figure 3: Change in gun murders', x = 'Year', y = 'Precent of murders with gun as weapon', caption="The vertical line indicates 1994, the year the crime bill was passed") +
  transition_time(year) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1994) +
  ease_aes('linear') 
```


```{r}
gun_summ_reg <- murder_cb %>%
  group_by(year, region) %>%
  summarize(perc_gun = sum(gun==1)/n())
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gun_summ_reg, mapping = aes(x = year, y = perc_gun, color=region)) +
  geom_point_interactive(show.legend = FALSE) +
  transition_time(year) +
  labs(title = 'Figure 4: Change in gun murders by region', x = 'Year', y = 'Precent of murders with gun as weapon', caption="The vertical line indicates 1994, the year the crime bill was passed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1994) +
  facet_wrap(.~region)

```

Figure 3 shows a marked increase in proportion of murders involving guns leading up to the passage of the bill, and then generally a decrease afterwards. There does seem to be a spike around the year 2003, however. Looking at the changes by US region in Figure 4, it seems that the Midwest region is mainly responsible for the spike (further investigation would be needed to examine why). Overall, though, this sugggests that the crime bill may in fact have been generally effective at decreasing the proportion of gun-related murders. 

Another specific element of the crime bill allowed for more funding for police officers; we might suspect that this increase would lead to more murders being solved, since there would be more law enforcement officers available to work on solving murder cases.  Again, we can look at changes in percent of murders that were solved over the years before and after the 1994 crime bill; here in Figure 5, we look at those percentages by state with states group into region. Over time, we see sort of a random movement of points; there is no trend of the states' percentages increasing post-1994. Therefore it seems that there was no clear change in how many murders were solved after the passage of the bill. 

```{r}
murder <- murder %>%
 mutate(region= ifelse(state %in% Northeast, "Northeast", ifelse(state %in% Midwest, "Midwest", ifelse(state %in% South, "South", "West"))))
```


```{r eval=F}
tem1 = murder %>%
  select(year, solved, region, state) %>%
  filter(year>=1985 & year <=2004) %>%
  group_by(region, year, state) %>%
  summarize(perc_unsolved = sum(solved == "No")/n()) %>% 
  mutate(hom_count = NA)
tem2 = murder %>%
  filter(year>=1985 & year <=2004) %>%
  group_by(region, year, state) %>%
  summarize(hom_count = n())
tem1$hom_count = tem2$hom_count
ggplot(tem1, aes(x = hom_count, y = perc_unsolved, size = 1, colour = state)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = F) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 8)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~region) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  labs(title = 'Figure 5: Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Total Number of Homicides', y = 'Percentage of Unsolved Homicides') +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

Our analysis has shown that the years following the passage of the crime bill saw mixed success in terms of reducing homicides, which was presuambly the main goal of the bill. Although we cannot infer causal relationships from our results, they provide food for thought. Focusing in on a couple of specific aspects of the bill, we saw that one aspect appeared to be successful in reducing the use of guns in homicides, whereas another aspect did not appear to be successful in increasing the rate of solved murders. Therefore, we speculate that the mixed success of the bill in reducing homicides may be due to varying levels of success of the individual components of the bill. 

### Design Choices

For Figures 1 and 2, we mainly wanted to indicate at a glance whether the homicide number/rate in each state had risen or not, and also the magnitude of the change. A color-coded map was appropriate because we could use different colors to show increase versus decrease, and saturation of color to show the magnitude simultaneously. For Figures 3 and 4, we wanted to to show some time-dependent animation of the percentage of gun murders over the years, which is effective at capturing not only the post-bill decrease but also other trends, such as the fact that percentage of gun murders was steadily increasing leading up to 1994. For Figure 5, we wanted to incorporate a lot of information about the solved percentage into a single graphic because we wanted to see whether the overall lack of a change was also reflected in the states indivudally.
