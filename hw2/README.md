# STA 523 :: Homework 2

## Tasks

#### Task 1

Create a new class for the S3 OO system along with two methods. Include 
constructor, validator, and helper functions. Demonstrate your class and methods
with some examples. One example of inspiration for an S3 class is given by the
"Roman" class. See  `?utils::as.roman()`. Be sure to describe your class and its
functionality.

#### Task 2

Re-implement function `is.armstrong()` from Homework 1 by pooling your 
solutions, using the new topics we have covered, and using topics from
Jenny Bryan's talk. Make it as clean and elegant as possible. Include test 
cases of expected and unexpected inputs.
