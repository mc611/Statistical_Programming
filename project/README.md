# STA 523 :: Project

## Requirements

1. Your project must be reproducible.

2. You should include a report using Rmarkdown detailing your project's main 
   objective, data, methods, results, and references. I should be able to set 
   `code_folding: hide` in your YAML header and easily read and 
   understand your project.

3. Your project must involve statistics.

4. You may not use data already used in this course without my approval.

5. Your project must include some aspect of R beyond what was introduced in
   this course. This can be an extension of some topic or be 
   something entirely new.

6. You must include a `Makefile` that builds your final report by
   connecting all dependencies.
